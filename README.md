# Career Program Effectiveness Analysis Project - A/B Testing

## *Goal*

We conducted a comprehensive data analysis project applying various statistical methodologies to evaluate the impact of ACME Manufacturing's Career 2030 training program on employee promotions. The project aimed to directly compare the promotion rates between participants and non-participants through A/B testing, thereby proving the effectiveness of the training program.

## *Project Execution*

- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: As the initial preparation work for the analysis, we carried out data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Application of Analytical Methodologies: Faced with data incompleteness, the presence of multiple covariates, and the potential for unobserved confounders despite being an RCT, we collaborated with team members to study various statistical methodologies. In particular, we implemented Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) to balance the covariates and executed Instrumental Variable (IV) analysis to address the issue of unobserved confounders.
- Outcome Derivation: The analysis showed that program participation significantly improved the likelihood of employee promotions. Specifically, using distance as an instrumental variable in IV analysis, we were able to identify the impact of distance on training participation rates.

## *Learning and Strategic Recommendations*

- Through this project, we gained an understanding of the complexity of data analysis and learned how to effectively apply various statistical methodologies.
- Based on the analysis results, we suggested the company continue the training program and implement remote education programs or commute support programs to mitigate the impact of distance.
- These strategies are expected to enhance the accessibility and participation rates of the program, contributing to the career development of employees and the overall growth of the company.
